# SwiftProjects
These are Nathan's programming projects from his explorations of iOS programming with Swift during the summer of 2017. They are as follows:

- Coin Collection App

This was my his first major iOS programming project. Nathan have been collecting circulating commemorative quaters for years since has was first exposed to U.S.’s “50 State Quarters Program,” and found it extremely frustrating to not have a mobile record of my collection. Thus, he created this app so that he and other collectors could carry and maintain a portable record of their collection. It could be especially useful if a collector unexpectedly sees a coin he wants and wants to check if he already has such one like it. One useful capability is the ability to sort the coins in a collection by categories [ex: coins having the same year, of the same country, and etc.].

- Note Taker

Nathan created it because he grew frustrated with other popular note-taking apps and wanted try my hand at creating one. One particular feature that I enjoy about this app is that it integrates voice-over reading of a note’s texts. This improve the accessibility of using one’s phone for note-taking for people with poor vision.

- Spaceship Shooter and Pong Games

These were the first games that Nathan has made for iOS using SpriteKit. The goal was to learn how SpriteKit works. Some of Nathan's favorite features in the Spaceship Shooter game are the usage of the device's accelerometer to change a player’s spaceship position, user-friendly tutorial, and multiple levels which range from being easy to being extremely hard. There are also multiple levels for the pong game as well as a multiplayer option.
